!!Silencer!!

Context:

Notifications and system sounds annoy you while you are using the phone. So you put the phone in vibration mode immediately.
You also curse yourself when you miss a call or notification when the phone is away and is in silent mode because you forgot to turn it back to sound mode.
Does it happen with you. It happens with me all the time!

What the app does:

This small utility app is a result of the motivation to remove this pain in my daily life.
Keeps the phone in vibrate/silent mode when you are using it.
Keeps it in sound mode when the phone is locked.
It also has option to set phone to complete silent during a daily schedule in the nights.

Challenge:

The challenge was to make it as a background service that is invisible to the user but running always.

Things to do:

Make a nice little widget to toggle the service quickly when needed.
